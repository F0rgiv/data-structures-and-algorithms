# Singly Linked List
Impliment a linkedList Class within Java from scratch.

## Challenge
Impliment a linkedList Class within Java from scratch.

## Approach & Efficiency
Insertions take a constant time of O(1).
toString take a time of O(N).

## linkedList/LinkedList
val length: Equals the current 
Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
